# gggmvis

gene model visualization with ggplot2 idiom

We want to be able to use plotly with a figure like
the following.  The arrows are expressed regions in
ORMDL3 (with different vertical displacements for different
transcripts) and the colored patches are binding sites
reported in ENCODE for CEBPB in the cell types noted in the legend.

We include in this package some facilities for creating
such plots with ggplot2, ensembldb, and AnnotationHub.
